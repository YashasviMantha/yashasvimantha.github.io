
Hi, I am Yashasvi! I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** and I like **plants**, **technology**, and **history**.

As an ML engineer, specializing in dealing with textual data (**NLP**), I help teams build everything from high quality datasets to productionizing NLP models. Right now, I am interested in developing scalable retrieval and search systems.

Iâ€™m passionate about open source software, minimal design, and food forests. This small piece of internet is home to my ever growing brain dumps.
