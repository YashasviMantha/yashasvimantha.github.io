# Why I shifted to my current website template.

2024-10-13

I have come to realising that all the website on the internet (atleast a major chunk of them) as being over engineered. 

For example my old website was extreamly bloated. So bloated that I went on a spree to remove random chunks of source code and it seamed to work the same. Maybe some chunks were not directly but indirectly necessary. Nevertheless, the point I am trying to make is it had a lot of 'not so useful' content. 

But it did have really good UI. All kinds of animations, parallax effects. Beautiful colors etc etc.
